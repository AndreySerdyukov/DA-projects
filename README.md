# Data Analysis Projects

This folder contains various data analysis projects built using Python. The projects utilize libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib** to process, analyze, and visualize data. Additionally, you'll find algorithms and test tasks related to data analysis, providing solutions to different real-world problems.

## Projects Included

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Projects focusing on preprocessing data, handling missing values, and transforming datasets into usable formats
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Projects that involve exploring datasets, identifying patterns, visualizing data, and drawing insights
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implementations of statistical tests and analyses using Python, with libraries like `scipy` and `statsmodels`
- **Visualization**: Various visualizations created using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to communicate data insights clearly and effectively
