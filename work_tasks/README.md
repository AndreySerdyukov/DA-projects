# Work Tasks with Open Data

This repository contains solutions to tasks from work, where open datasets were used. The project demonstrates basic data manipulation techniques, including working with regular expressions (re) and performing join operations to combine data efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: Applied for pattern matching and data extraction
- **Join Operations**: Merging datasets based on common columns
