# Car Count and Traffic Accidents Correlation Analysis

This project explores the correlation between the number of cars in Europe during the 20th and 21st centuries and the number of traffic accidents. The goal is to understand how the increase in car ownership might influence road safety over time.

## Objectives

- Analyze the trend in car ownership in Europe during the 20th and 21st centuries
- Examine the correlation between the number of cars and the number of traffic accidents
- Investigate if an increase in the number of cars correlates with a rise in traffic accidents

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Number of cars in the 20th and 21st centuries**: Data on car ownership across different years
- **Number of traffic accidents**: Data on traffic accidents in Europe for corresponding periods

## Methodology

1. Data preprocessing and visualization to identify trends
2. Correlation analysis between car ownership and traffic accidents
3. Interpretation of the results to draw meaningful conclusions
