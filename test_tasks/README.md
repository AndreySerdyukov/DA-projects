# Data Analysis and Algorithm Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to various data analysis tasks and sometimes algorithmic challenges. The focus is primarily on real-world data manipulation, statistical modeling, and algorithm implementation.

## Tools and Libraries Used

I leverage the following tools and libraries to perform data analysis and develop algorithms:

- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling large datasets.
- **SciPy**: For scientific and technical computing, particularly useful in optimization and statistics.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and visually appealing plots and charts.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling and performing hypothesis tests.
