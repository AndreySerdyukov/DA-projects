# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Project

This project focuses on building a model to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing activations on a target KPI using the provided dataset. The solution will incorporate key components of Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), which aims to understand the impact of various marketing activities on business outcomes.

## Data

- **Dataset**: Contains information about marketing activations and their corresponding target KPI.
- **Data Description**: The dataset includes features related to marketing efforts and their impact on performance metrics. Specific columns may include budget allocation, media channels, and the target KPI values.

## Objective

- The goal is to build a model that accurately measures the effectiveness of marketing activations on the target KPI.
- The solution should include:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
  - **Model Construction**: Building a predictive model to assess the relationship between marketing activations and KPI performance.
  - **Media Transformation**: Transforming media-related data into formats suitable for analysis.
  - **Decomposition**: Breaking down the overall impact of marketing efforts into different components.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the quality of the model using appropriate metrics.
  - **Forecasting**: Making predictions for future marketing campaigns and their expected outcomes.
  - **Media Mix Optimization**: Suggesting the optimal allocation of resources across different marketing channels to maximize the KPI.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, outliers, and scale the features.
2. **Model Building**: Use regression-based methods, such as linear or non-linear models, to model the relationship between marketing activities and the KPI.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
4. **Forecasting**: Generate predictions for future data and validate the model with hold-out datasets.
5. **Optimization**: Use optimization techniques to recommend the best allocation of marketing resources.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **statsmodels**: For statistical modeling.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization.
